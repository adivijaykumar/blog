My resume can be found [here](https://github.com/adivijaykumar/resume/blob/master/main.pdf). (A more formal page is [perennially] under construction)

# Resources

 * A huge set of lecture notes on [John McGreevy's website](https://mcgreevy.physics.ucsd.edu/).

 * Another huge set of lecture notes on [David Tong's website](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html). His lecture notes and videos on Quantum Field Theory are fun!

 * Daniel Harlow's lectures on [Black Holes and Quantum Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1231) provides a brilliant review of the recent attempts at connection between the two fields.
 
 * Thomas Hartman's lectures on [Quantum Gravity and Black Holes](http://www.hartmanhep.net/topics2015/).
