Why do weeks have to be so hectic?

Not much to say this week.

[Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35620555-miss-laila-armed-and-dangerous?ac=1&from_search=true) is perhaps Manu Joseph's best book, but certainly not by a mile. I just liked how he blended so many actual controversies / people and created a funny, gritty, fast-paced mashup.

Spent quite some time in writing my mid-semester report. Happy that I am done with it.

Nothing else. Bye. Next week.
