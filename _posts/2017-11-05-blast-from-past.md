_Oasis_, for those readers who don't know, is the cultural festival organized by the student community at BITS, Pilani, held in the month of October or November. _Oasis 2017_ was held this week at Pilani, and I have never missed Pilani and its people more than I did this week. This came as weird shock to me, considering I have never liked Oasis, and have even critiqued it quite vocally for its many faults. I think these periodic shocks are pretty amazing ways to identify what matters to you the most. True, I hated Oasis, but I realized I was in love with the idea of it - four complete days of being with people most special to me, and creating memories. Also, memories, dear reader, are bitches.

But I don't really feel like ruminating all my Pilani related thoughts today. So, very conveniently, I managed to stumble on a poem I had written in 2009. I wrote it as an entry for my school magazine, and my cousin also plagiarized it in her school magazine. Anyway, this is probably the only poem written in my school days I am still in possession of.

You might think the poem would be an early teenager's angst about society. No, it wasn't! It was a hagiographic poem about Barack Obama. I still do not recollect why I chose Obama as my subject; maybe I will remember it someday. Given below, is the full-text of the poem, unedited. Please take a moment to smile at my forced rhymes, and stupid poetry.


# Barack Hussein Obama

_O America, a wonderful gift you have got_  
_A person, vibrant, challenging and hot_  
_Known by people near and far_  
_By the person of Barack Hussein Obama._

_Though an African-American you are_  
_'Change' you will bring to the world_  
_You indeed have becpome a star_  
_With steps humble and pearled._

_Through all barriers boldly you stood_  
_Undergoing troubled times, bitter and rude_  
_You showed the world through pure simplicity_  
_'Change' you will be in the world for good._

_O Obama, it's now that you say_  
_Arise, O America, call it a day_  
_Bring joy to the shattered_  
_And hope to the hopeless_  
_Love to the lonely_  
_And employment for the jobless_  
_Enrich other countries to build a new world_  
_Where joy will never cease_  
_And all around will be pure peace._

_May your agenda be to help_  
_Fight poverty and terrorism_  
_To let the poor and weak countries grow_  
_And bridge nations with peace and harmony_  
_Build bridges over troubled lands_  
_And in friendship join friendly hands._
