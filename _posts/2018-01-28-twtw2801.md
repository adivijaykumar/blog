I really don't know what to make of this week at all. But anyway.

Didn't study QFT, because well, there were no lectures this week.

The _Myers et al_ paper is really well written. They sweat all the small stuff! To be more specific, they try to define complexity between two states, assuming initial and final states to be gaussian. It's really very simple, the paper, and is mostly written for the sake of writing it.

In the GW astronomy project, I ran into some trouble with data. Didn't get consistent results, so just baacktracked a step and tried to recoup what I was doing. Should have something in time for the presentation on Tuesday.

Finished reading _Ghachar Ghochar_ by Vivek Shanbag. Nice short read, but there was something missing. Here's my Goodreads review :-

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2252136917">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
3.5. Ghachar Ghochar tells the rags-to-riches story of a family, except it is not exactly a happy one. Nevertheless, it reflects the truth. Rich as fuck, unhappy families are in abundance at least in the metropolitan cities. This dysfunctional story is told in short (~120 pages), and is a breezy read.<br /><br />I do have this feeling that a lot of emotions were lost in translation (the book is translated from Kannada). But the fact that the story manages to arouse pity and sadness in such few words is worthy of admiration.

I have been very optimistic and picked up two books to read parallely. One is _The Elementary Particles_ by Michel Houllebecq - it is an interesting book at the outset, and has been liked and hated by many. A simple Google search for Houellebecq would tell you how controversial he is for evoking themes of sexism and Islamophobia in his work. You gotta read it to critique it!

The next one is _We That Are Young_ by Preti Taneja. This woman is such a good writer! Will reserve thoughts for now.

It's gonna be a busy few weeks ahead. Geared up! Also looking forward to attend the Times LitFest, Bengaluru next weekend, if all goes well.

Be well all :)
