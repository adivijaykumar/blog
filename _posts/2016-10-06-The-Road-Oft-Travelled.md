The Road oft travelled, yes, the one I’m on  
I look around, puzzled, what’s going on?  
These ones around, murky, in puddles of sin  
Writhing and rolling, loud, in endless din  

And then one said, straight, a held-up chin  
“Think not, mister, hurry, join in, we are kin!”  
I concede, accepting, my eyes again on  
The Road oft travelled, yes yes, the one I’m on.
