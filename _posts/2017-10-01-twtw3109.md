I turned 22 this week!

Finished reviewing [The Entanglement Timescale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05792.pdf) paper by Sheng-Yang finally! Nice paper it was. But wasn't able to review the one extra 'punishment' paper. :(

The third GRE mock better than the other two. :)

[American Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30165203-american-gods) is going on. It is an interesting read. Meanwhile, I managed to get my hands on Manu Joseph's latest [Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35620555-miss-laila-armed-and-dangerous?ac=1&from_search=true).

Watched Newton! It was an enthralling, emotional watch. A good choice for the Oscars!

Also attended a concert by Baiju Dharmajan at Blue Frog on Friday. That guy is a sensation! The band that opened, Param, was also really good. The vocalist has amazing range!

Started looking at [Second Law of Quantum Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01107) by Adam Brown and Leonard Susskind.

Still haven't started off with Quantum Fields in Curved Spacetime. Long week ahead, lots to be done, I should buck up.

And so should you!
