Finally, a good week! Did not work for the first two days a lot, but picked up speed in the later half and loved it. 

Started watching Thanu Padmanabhan's QFT Lectures, and man, they are amazing! I also tweeted one revelation I had while watching the lectures.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just discovered (almost serendipitously) that Thanu Padmanabhan is ambidextrous! Mind Blown!<br><br>He is the best lecturer I have ever seen btw.</p>&mdash; Aditya Vijaykumar (@alsogoesbyV) <a href="https://twitter.com/alsogoesbyV/status/926490147868196864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote>

Thesis work is also very interesting, will write a long post about it sometime.

Currently reading two books - _Flowers for Algernon_ by Daniel Keyes and _Half Lion_ by Vinay Sitapati. Both look good, more details later.

Went to one of Bangalore's oldest pubs, and also learnt some history about the pub culture in Bangalore and its current state. A lot of food for though. Again, long blog post about this sometime too.

Looking forward, all energized, to next week!
