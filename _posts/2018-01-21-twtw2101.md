Wassup fellas! This was perhaps one of the most satisfying weeks of my stay in Bangalore!

I started really _learning_ renormalization. I think it is one of the most physically intuitive pieces in the landscape of quantum field theory, and in fact the most fun I have had while learning something. Studying doesn't feel like _studying_ when it is fun.

I started work on the next leg of the complexity project, and am currently poring over two papers on defining complexity in QFT by _Myers et al_ and _Chapman et al_. Early glances show that Myers discretizes the QFT space to define complexity, which is _a la_ Nielsen's geometric interpretation of complexity. Chapman on the other hand considers the continuum limit itself. Should be interesting reads.

In the gravitational waves project, I built more intuition for the two point correlation function, and what they actually mean in position and theta space. Read up about why the heck one would expect a peak due to Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the correlation data. Next week will involve trying to reproduce plots from one of the standard SDSS BOSS collaboration papers. I had planned to start this itself, but turned out that the data I was working with had some problems in it :(. No problem.

IISc has its annual festival this week, and some great quizzes! I attended one on Friday, and participated informally, and ended up topping the prelims and second in finals. But no prize, coz not registered :(. Also _Thaikkudam Bridge_ is performing today, and really looking forward to it.

In the last TWTW, I forgot to talk about the books that I had read over the winters. I'll let my Goodreads reviews do the talking. I have a new found literary love - Gabriel Garcia Marquez! Currently reading _Ghachar Ghochar_ by Vivek Shanbag, a short book.

In 2008, I was overjoyed, as schools were shut down in Pune. Now, I was almost reduced to tears by some stories in the book. Especially those of Karambir Kang, and Faustine Martis. Strength to everyone still reeling from the loss and trauma.

Some 3-star essays, but boy, those 5-star essays were absolutely amazing!

I have been very wary of reading classics, even the more modern ones. I have known Marquez's work for a few years now, but have put off reading him for the same reason. But I somehow gathered up the motivation to give his shortest book a go.<br /><br />You know that feeling when you come across something totally new, totally mindblowing, and hence lose the ability to describe the feeling in words? That is exactly the state I am in. The only thing I can conclude right now is that Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most artistically brilliant authors I read. And that I have a strong liking for magical realism.<br /><br />At 120 pages, it is hardly a two-day read. A nice, short introduction to Marquez's style, I am sure everyone who likes it would want to delve into his other work as soon as possible.

A lot of things lined up for next week! Hope it is a good one for me.

And for you too :)
