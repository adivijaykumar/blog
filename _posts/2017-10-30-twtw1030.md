Was off blogging for close to three weeks, not done. But I was busy preparing for Physics GRE, which I took on 28th. I am happy it is done!

I haven't been able to do much in these days, apart from studying of course. But on 28th and 29th I did attend the Bangalore Literature Festival, and I shall write a bigger post about that. Have to start planning what to do in the weeks ahead!

Will blog regularly!
