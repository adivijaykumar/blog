title: About Me

---

My name is Aditya Vijaykumar.

- I was born in **Perinthalmanna, Kerala** in 1995, but have lived in **Pune, Maharashtra** all my life. I am deeply fond of Pune and Kerala and feel a connect to both places.

- I currently reside in the city of **Bengaluru, Karnataka**, where I am pursuing my PhD in Physics at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://icts.res.in/) (ICTS). If you are ever in Bengaluru and want to break away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I suggest you visit our campus to enjoy our hospitality and also learn about some interesting science being done. ICTS also has a plethora of public events which you could be interested in.

- I was an undergraduate student at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani** pursuing **Physics** and **Mechanical Engineering** as my majors. Pilani was a fantastic place, and it made me a better human being. 

- Physics, specifically aspects of theoretical physics such as General Relativity and Quantum Theory of Fields, interest me quite a bit. Currently, I am working on some problems in Gravitational Waves. Check my [academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/academic/) for more.

- I like reading, writing, listening to poetry (very recently), quizzing, and thinking about art of cinema and music. Check my [non-academic page](https://adivijaykumar.github.io/nonacademic/) for more.
